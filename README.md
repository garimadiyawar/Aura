## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Uses speech recognition to capture and interpret voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides spoken feedback using text-to-speech technology.
- **Create Notepad Files**: Quickly create and save text files on your system with voice commands.
- **Maintain To-Do List in Notion**: Manage your tasks in Notion by adding new items to your to-do list.

### Setting Up Notion Integration

1. Create a Notion integration and note down the integration token and database ID. [Notion API Documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:
   ```env
   NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_integration_token

   ```

### Run the Application

```

## Configuration

### Notion Integration

Ensure your Notion integration token and database ID are correctly set in the `.env` file.

### Text-to-Speech

The text-to-speech functionality uses `pyttsx3`, which requires no additional configuration. However, you can customize the voice and rate directly in the code if needed.

## Usage

2. **Voice Commands**:
   - "Create a notepad file": Aura will prompt you to provide a filename and content, and then create the file.
   - "Add a task to Notion": Aura will add a new task to your Notion to-do list.

### Example Commands
